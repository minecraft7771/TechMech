This mod adds a Mechsuit entity to Minecraft.
The Mechsuit functions as a rideable entity that can sprint and jump like a horse. Projectiles may be fired from the Mechsuit and Blocks can be placed or broken with a greater range. This mod is currently under heavy development.
TODO:
- Add Texture
- Handle that the player may not break a block (Unbreakable blocks like Bedrock)
- Add Silk/Fortune to Mech-Miningtool
- Add Nightvision to the user of the mech
- Add abilitiy to fly
- Add recipes and gate abilities behind modules
- Add GUI overlay for mech health and status
- Add Mech inventory container
